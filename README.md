# 🌋 Tephrite

Build Mojo packages from projects.

[Magic](https://docs.modular.com/magic/) is a package manager for Mojo projects.
Build Mojo packages such that they can be published, searched, added, and installed.

**⚠️ Warning 🧪 Experimental Code 🚧 Under Construction**

# 🔌 Use

Just `tephrite` without arguments prints the usage.

## Setup

Install Magic.

[Build](#-develop) the main module, because Mojo does not support main functions in packages yet.

Check the version with `tephrite v`.

# 💡 Rationale

The standard library [`builtin` package](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/builtin/) is imported automatically.
The [other standard library packages](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/functional/)
are imported from the installation directory of the library.
Other packages are imported from the directory of the main module
or directories specified as `-I` options for the commands
[`mojo build`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/cli/build#-i-path),
[`mojo run`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/cli/run#-i-path), and
[`mojo package`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/cli/package#-i-path).

Mojo packages are imported from [directories or package files](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/packages) in the file system.
Installing a package stores it in the file system.

What is the module search order?

# 🪛 Develop

with [Git](https://git-scm.com/book) and [Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/).

1. Clone with `git clone https://github.com/gerald-scharitzer/tephrite.git`
2. Enter with `cd tephrite`
3. Start the Magic shell with `magic shell`
4. Test with `mojo test`
5. Run with `mojo src/main.mojo`
6. Build with `mkdir -p target && mojo build -o target/tephrite src/main.mojo`
7. Execute with `target/tephrite`
8. Package with `mojo package -o target src/tephrite`
9. Document with `mojo doc -o target/tephrite-doc.json src/tephrite`
10. Sync `VERSION` in [`tephrite/__init__.mojo`](src/tephrite/__init__.mojo) and [`test_tephrite.mojo`](src/test_tephrite.mojo)
11. Sync `USAGE` in [`cli.mojo`](src/cli.mojo) and [`README.md` section "Use"](#-use)
12. Stage with `git add`
13. Commit with `git commit -m "message"` where `message` describes the changes
14. Push branch with `git push`
15. Tag with `git tag version` where `version` is the [semantic version](https://semver.org/)
16. Push tag with `git push origin tag` where `tag` is the version
17. Clean with `rm -r target`

# 📋 Backlog

Publish Mojo packages as Conda packages.

`mojo doc` all source files, when it can generate something more human-readable than JSON.

Process packages independent from their containing file system structure.

- dev scripts
- unit tests
- integration tests
- doc tests
- review license

## Issues

Array of literals cannot be subscripted (runtime error).

Code diagnostics cannot resolve imports from nested tests.
